        <h1>dita-project-best-practices</h1>
        <p>A small DITA project skeleton exemplifying best practices to reuse content and to manage
            links. The project favors using DITA 1.2 keyref indirect links over direct DITA 1.1
            links.</p>
        <p>If you want to start a DITA project from zero, obeying such a structure may help you
            in:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Growing the project in a healthy sustainable way.</li>
            <li>Give you a good overview over what you are reusing.</li>
            <li>Allow easier link management.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Let's try to take a look at the resources which comprise this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"talking-circle.ditamap" - The main project DITA Map. In our case it's a small
                example DITA Map discussing about an hypothetical software application.</li>
            <li>"filters" - This folder contains all DITAVAL filter files which are used to obtain
                various outputs from the project contents.</li>
            <li>"images" - This folder contains all image files used in the project. You can add
                various subfolders to it.</li>
            <li>"links" - This folder contains various link-related mappings: <ul>
                    <li>"externalLinks.ditamap" - Contains key definitions for all your external
                        links, usually links to external web resources.</li>
                    <li>"internalLinks.ditamap" - Contains key definitions for the project's topics
                        referenced from other topics.</li>
                    <li>"relationshipTable.ditamap" - Contains the relationship table describing
                        links between various topics.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>"reuse" - This folder contains mappings for reused content: <ul>
                    <li>"reusableComponents.dita" - This topic contains a list of reusable elements.
                        For each element there is a description which instructs the technical writer
                        how to reuse it. In a larger project there are probably more than one such
                        topics.</li>
                    <li>"reusableImageReferences.ditamap" - Maps keys for each used image.</li>
                    <li>"reusableProductNames.ditamap" - Defines small pieces of text which can be
                        reused using keyref.</li>
                    <li>"reusables.ditamap" - Binds together all these resources, assigns a key for
                        the reusable components topic.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>"tasks, topics, concepts, references, etc" - Folders which contain the actual DITA
                content, either split in subfolders by topic type or by some other project-specific
                role.</li>
        </ul>
